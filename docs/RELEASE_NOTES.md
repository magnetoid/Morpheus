## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-20

The current foundation release. Highlights since the platform came together:

### SEO & structured data (rich results)
- **One complete, valid Product** rich result per product page — offer with
  price, availability, shipping, return policy, `itemCondition`, and
  `priceValidUntil`, plus absolute `image`, `brand`, and review stars
  (`aggregateRating` + `review`) when reviews exist.
- **Google Book structured data** — Work → Edition → ReadAction, with `sameAs`
  (Open Library) + OCLC identifier so public-domain titles are reconcilable
  without fabricated ISBNs.
- **VideoObject** for product videos, and an enriched **Organization** graph
  (contact point + postal address) for the brand knowledge panel.
- **Rich-snippets editor** gained Book + enriched Article types.
- Fixed the AMP Web Story canonical error (stories are now standalone /
  self-canonical).

### Catalog & books
- **Identifier fields** (ISBN-13 / OCLC / Open Library work ID) on the product
  edit form, plus a bulk `backfill_book_identifiers` command that reconciles the
  catalog against Open Library with conservative title+author matching.

### Storefront
- Editorial homepage hero, bigger grid titles with first-sentence excerpts.

### Platform
- **Version & updates** page in Settings (this page), backed by this document.
- **Morpheus Brain** (Settings → Morpheus Brain) — a tabbed intelligence console
  that aggregates plugin health, code analysis & self-improvement, content &
  SEO, storefront Core Web Vitals, and improvement recommendations, read-only
  from the platform's own engines.
- **Book identifiers** — ISBN-13 / OCLC / Open Library fields on the product
  form, plus the `backfill_book_identifiers` bulk reconciliation command.
